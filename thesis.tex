\begin{acknowledgements}
Firstly and most importantly, I must thank my outstanding research advisor, Dan Licata. Dan took me under his wing when I was only a freshman, and spent countless hours of his valuable time gently teaching me the ways of programming language research. In the years since, he's become an amazing mentor, a wonderful collaborator, and a great friend. For all this, I will be eternally grateful.

I am also incredibly lucky to have been simultaneously mentored by Norman Danner. On top of being the spiritual leader of the Wesleyan PL cost-analysis group and the driving force in shaping my research interests, Norman is an absolutely stellar professor, from whom I had the pleasure of taking multiple courses and seminars.

I would like to express my gratitude to my readers, Dan, Norman, and Robert Rose, for taking the time to read this tome.

A huge amount of thanks also goes out to Deepak Garg, who, over a high-top table at the hotel bar at POPL 2020, offered to host me at MPI-SWS for the internship that became Chapter 2 of this thesis. I also appreciate his generosity in agreeing to work with me virtually when a global pandemic decided to upend my summer-in-Germany plans.

I am very grateful for the joint friend/mentor-ship offered by Joomy Korkut, Alex Kavvos, and Mitchell Riley, all of whom seamlessly and rapidly alternate between being outstanding friends, kind mentors, and non-judgmental shoulders to cry on.

I would be remiss not to mention the rotating cast of characters who have inhabited ESC341 and ESC345, my two ``offices" during my time at Wesleyan: Yulia, Pi, Rocco, Elliott, Vabuk, and Ed, you all made it worth trudging through the CT cold to come to the office each day. Similarly, I would like to thank the many denizens of the 6th floor math lounge for providing yet another comfortable and fun working environment.

Of course, as is true of all such projects, this thesis would not have been possible without the emotional support of my wonderful housemates and friends. Sam, Shea, Rachel, the gang from $(\N \to \N) \to (\N \to \N) \to (\N \to \N)$, and the folks from the PL-twitterverse have all been instrumental in keeping me sane during the madness that has been 2020 and 2021.

Finally, I must acknowledge the tremendous support my family has provided me through college, and during the past year especially. Mom, Dad, and Nathaniel: I got to spent more time with you than I was expecting to this year, and I'm thankful for it every day.
